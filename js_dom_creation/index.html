    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is John, I am 27 years old and have many interests including gaming, outdoor sports, and camping.
        my previous work experience is mostly in retail. I am taking this class to acquire the skills to become a
        successful web developer. The type of job I would like to get would hopefully be in front end development for
        a large and successful company. I am interested in front end because creating new, exciting, and engaging website
        functions seems good for me.
